# Chimp Test

This small memory game is built using GUI pygame and meant to recreate the Chimp Test from Human Benchmark (https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/chimp). The game works by having the user memorize a grid of randomly positioned and numbered blocks, and after memorization, they are tasked with clicking the blocks in a certain order without seeing the number. The more progress they make, the more numbered blocks will be added, requiring more memorization.
